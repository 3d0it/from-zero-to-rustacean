# From zero to rusteacen
As promised here https://medium.com/@3d0/i-need-to-be-a-rustacean-d19015df3854, I want to share with you some of the things I do to improve my Rust skills.

This is (always) work in progress!

1. Book Zero From Production in Rust - https://www.zero2prod.com/
   - Stop Reading after Chapter 2, put it on hold and look for something more beginner-friendly
1. Rust Book - https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/
   - The Book. Period. I red first 6 chapters. I plan to continue reading it until the end.
1. Welcome to Learn Rust from Scratch from educative.io - https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-rust-from-scratch
   - Free fun and interactive basic course. It has quizzes, coding challenges, and projects that you can do in your browser.
1. Rustilings - https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings
   - Popular project with small exercises to solve using Rust. I've been doing this alongside reading the Rust Book and it helps me reinforce what I learn.
1. Let's get rusty - https://www.youtube.com/c/LetsGetRusty
   - This is a YouTube channel that has videos on various topics related to Rust. It's based on the Rust Book but it adds some extra explanations and examples. I've watched a few videos and they were very helpful and easy to follow.
1. Chip 8 Emulator - https://github.com/aquova/chip8-book
   - This is a fun project that I did recently where I built a chip 8 emulator using Rust. Chip 8 is an old-school virtual machine that can run simple games. It was a great way to learn more about low-level programming and Rust features. You can check out my implementation here: https://github.com/3d0it/chip8
